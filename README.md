Coding Challenges done in Scala
======

This is a collection of my coding challenges from various source ([HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codility](https://codility.com), [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/), etc) using Scala. The goal of this series is to keep the code as concise and efficient as possible. It might not be perfect due to the limitation of my ability and skill, so feel free to make suggestions if you spot something that can be improved.
